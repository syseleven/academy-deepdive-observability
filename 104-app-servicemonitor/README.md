## Deploy a serviceMonitor for your own application

Now we want to use a more straight-forward way how to collect metrics from our application.
This is done through a mechanism Prometheus offers. It is called serviceMonitors.

### Prepare a serviceMonitor

**This installation is required in every participants namespace.**

* View the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) Prometheus installed

  ```shell
  kubectl get crd | grep monitoring
  ```

  Result:
  
  ```shell
  alertmanagerconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com   2023-01-19T15:26:12Z
  alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com         2023-01-19T15:26:13Z
  podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com           2023-01-19T15:26:15Z
  probes.monitoring.coreos.com                2023-01-19T15:26:16Z
  prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com          2023-01-19T15:26:18Z
  prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com       2023-01-19T15:26:19Z
  servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com       2023-01-19T15:26:21Z
  thanosrulers.monitoring.coreos.com          2023-01-19T15:26:22Z
  ```

* We make use of the serviceMonitor CRD and deploy it for our application

* First edit the file `app-servicemonitor.yaml` and adjust the name of your namespace

  ```yaml
    # app-servicemonitor.yaml
    [...]
    namespaceSelector:
      matchNames:
        - <YOURNAME> #<-- please adjust your namespace here
    [...]
  ```

### Deploy the serviceMonitor

* then deploy the serviceMonitor to your namespace 

  ```shell
  read -p "Please enter your name (without blanks e.g. johndoe): " YOURNAME
  export YOURNAME
  kubectl -n ${YOURNAME} apply -f app-servicemonitor.yaml
  ```
* Verify it is deployed: `kubectl -n ${YOURNAME} get servicemonitor`

* View the result in prometheus web interface, after a while:
  * target
  * metrics with detailled labels

* Recap how serviceMonitor connects to the service and how the service connects to the pod

  ```shell
  kubectl -n ${YOURNAME} get po,svc,servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com --show-labels
  ```

### Conclusion

In this exercise we deployed a serviceMonitor for our application to leverage metrics discovery
by prometheus. As a result metrics contain even more pieces of information through labels.
